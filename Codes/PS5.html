     To infiltrate Hamburg, Germany, to obtain information about Project Phoenix and how the execution of such a plan 
     could change the course of the war. During the campaign we will know the stories of the soldiers who make up this 
     Task Force, made up of Arthur Kinglsey, Richard Webb, Polina Ptrova, Wade Jackson, Lucas Riggs and Private Novak, 
     and thus understand why they are the only ones who are prepared for this task.</p>

     <p class = "teoría">Far Cry 6 once again sees you trapped in a huge open world controlled by a charismatic madman, 
       this time on the fictional island nation of Yara. Even after this many games, the job of turning all the red dots
       on your map into blue ones is still a good time, whether by sneakily silencing every enemy guard or by going the
       less subtle route of throwing bullets and Molotovs at them until no one is left.Primarily modeled after Cuba, Yara 
       is ruled by fascistic dictator Anton Castillo, who’s expertly portrayed by notorious TV bad guy Giancarlo Esposito;
       with this performance, he has handily claimed the top spot on my list of favorite Far Cry villains (with apologies to Mr. Mando). 
       His regime would be too preposterously evil to believe at times, if not for its real-world South and Central American inspirations.
       But it’s his unwavering devotion to his vision of a “perfect” Yara, along with Esposito’s natural gravitas and the stoic 
       charm he projects to his still-loyal subjects, that make him a great foil to the chaotic diaspora of revolutionaries you’re 
       working to unite as you attempt to topple the regime of El Presidente and his lieutenants.</p>

    <p class = "teoría">A sequel that’s more akin to Uncharted: The Lost Legacy in terms of scale, Marvel’s Spider-Man Miles 
      Morales puts you in the Adidas-branded sneakers of the charismatic and rookie web-slinger, Miles. With Peter Parker off
      on holiday, it’s up to Miles to take over the stewardship of New York, and predictably, his first week on the job doesn’t
      go smoothly.</p>
